    	<h2>WHY ARE WE OFFERING ID RECOVERY SERVICES NOW?</h2>
        <p>The truth is that we have been offering ID theft protection for a couple of years. However, first, let's talk about the problem of ID Theft. It seems that hardly a week goes by where we do not hear something about a data breach or an unsecured laptop containing confidential information being stolen. That is only the tip of the iceberg. For the most part the problem starts closer to home. These days the bad guys have gotten much smarter. Failure to shred important papers and credit card offers provide a source of information for an ID thief. Most people do not realize that they often contribute to this growing problem by not safeguarding their personal information. An unattended mailbox is a bonanza for an ID thief. A bank statement, check reorders and credit card statements are typically shipped to consumers’ homes and placed in the mailbox. One may not immediately miss one of these items. However, if an ID thief is watching mailboxes for just these items, it does not take any time for him to appropriate them and set up a whole new series of financial accounts IN YOUR NAME. Consumers usually do not hear about this until a couple of months later when they start to receive collection calls or collection letters. Consumers are then surprised to learn that their credit bureau report includes new home purchases, automobile purchases and new credit cards. The problems do not stop there. One may discover that the information on his credit card was skimmed and now fraudulent charges have been assessed to his account. Straightening out the mess is a daunting process that often takes hundreds of hours. There are many ID Theft programs on the market. Indeed, some home owners' policies and credit card vendors offer such programs. It is wise to examine these programs closely. Most programs will provide advice as to how to proceed in restoration of your good name. However, they do not do the work for you. Others will provide an insurance benefit to reimburse you for the cost spent in restoring your credit or up to a specified dollar amount based on documented substantiated losses. This particular point is something to consider. Most ID thieves will plunder a victim's credit standing for all that they can get, easily eclipsing the amount of the insurance benefit. </p>
        <p>This is where the difference rests. Our ID SafeChoice will result in a full restoration of your credit. ID SafeChoice provides an Identity Recovery Advocate who will do all of the work so you do not have to take off of work or surrender your personal time to remedy the situation. Since ID SafeChoice returns your credit file to the status it was prior to the theft, there is no need for an insurance benefit. ID SafeChoice gives you the peace of mind knowing that for the low price of $1.95 per month, your credit rating is protected against ID Theft. When you factor in that members receive services for three generations of your family - you, your spouse or partner, your dependents up to age 25 with the same permanent address, and your parents living with you or in a hospice, nursing care or assisted living, with benefits up to 12 months after death, the $1.95 monthly cost represents a tremendous value. </p>
