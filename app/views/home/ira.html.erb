            <p>Major changes in IRA rules will make a good thing better for more members than ever before! </p>
            <p>Fast Facts about the new Roth IRA:</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><span class="bold">Expanded Availability</span> - The Roth IRA is open to those with Adjusted Gross Incomes (AGIs) as high as $160,000 for married couples, $110,000 for singles...nearly 4 times higher than for traditional IRAs. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Tax-free Distributions</span> - While contributions are not tax deductible, contributions and interest can be withdrawn tax-free. You pay 0% capital gains! </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Flexible Withdrawal Rules</span> - You are not required to begin taking required minimum distributions after reaching age 70 1/2 (as with traditional IRAs), and penalty-free withdrawals are permitted in the event of death or disability, qualified medical expenses, certain health insurance, first time home purchase (up to $10,000), qualified educational expenses or due to an IRS levy (provided the account has been in existence for 5 years). </li>
                <li><span class="bold">No Age Restrictions</span> - Contributions to a Roth IRA can continue past age 70 1/2, unlike traditional IRAs. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>The &quot;Old&quot; IRA has some other new looks too!</p>
            <ul>
            	<li><span class="bold">Coverdell ESA (formerly Education IRA)</span> - Allow you to put away up to $2,000 per year per child for higher education expenses, paying 0% capital gains tax upon withdraw.</li>
                <li><span class="bold">Education benefit</span> - Your contributions can be used to pay qualified elementary school and secondary school expenses as well as those for higher education. </li>
                <li><span class="bold">Traditional IRAs Expand</span> - Eligibility for fully deductible IRAs have been expanding.  Beginning in 2002 the annual contribution limit has been increased from $2000 to $3000, in 2005 to $4000, and in 2008 to $5000.  After 2008, the contribution limit will be adjusted annually for inflation in $500 increments. </li>
